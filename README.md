## Submitting additional resoruces
You can open an Issue on Github, and list more resources and I will try to add them after checking it out. Some guidelines:
1. Check the list itself and previous Issues before opening a new Issue, this is to avoid duplicates.
2. Link directly to the student/education version of the service/product.
3. Explain in a brief 1-2 sentences what the discount/credits is for and how much discount/credits is.
4. Give a brief 1-2 sentence summary of the service/product of of the company.
